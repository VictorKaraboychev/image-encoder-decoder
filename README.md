# image-encoder-decoder

Encodes arbitrary data in color data for png images, and decodes data from encoded images.

**Encoding**: Takes an arbitrary file type, reads the byte code, and hides the binary information within the color data of a png file.
**Decoding**: Reads the hidden binary information from a png file with encoded information.
